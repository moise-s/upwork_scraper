The problem we are having is that Socks5 with Authentication is not supported in Chromium, as well as most other mainstream browsers. To get around this, we found an out of date Node.js library that creates a basic HTTP proxy, and routes all of the traffic through the SOCKS5 proxy. This works great, unfortunately, it will not pass any IPv6 traffic though, which is a requirement for us. This is outside of the expertise of our team, so we are looking for someone who can update this library. I will pass on the github link of the library we are using that needs updating to those interested in direct.",
